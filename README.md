## 🗄️ Data Storage

IskoBot uses JSON files for data storage — no database required. All data is stored locally in the `src/data/` directory.

### `users.json`
Stores each student's Discord ID, username, and registered classes.
```json
{
  "123456789012345678": {
    "userId": "123456789012345678",
    "username": "john_doe",
    "classes": [
      { "course": "Math 21", "schedule": "TWHFX-1" },
      { "course": "Stat 117", "schedule": "THV" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `streaks.json`
Stores streak data per class channel.
```json
{
  "math-21-twhfx-1": {
    "streak": 5,
    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15",
    "todayUsers": ["123456789", "987654321", "112233445"]
  }
}
```

### `faqs.json`
Stores keyword-response pairs for the FAQ system.
```json
[
  {
    "keywords": ["enrollment", "enroll"],
    "response": "To enroll, visit the student portal at [link]."
  }
]
```

> ⚠️ The `src/data/` directory is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent student data from being committed to version control.
